    Hey my name is Anais and thanks for coming to my wonderful website...  <br>
    On November 15 a beauitful child named Anais S. Jaikissoon was born at 4:32pm <br>
  <h3> Early Life</h3> <br>
    There once was a small child who went to Public School 132 who discovered she loved the performing arts <br>
    This small child loved to dance and her favorite type of dance was Bollywood <br>

    From there on the little girl danced her heart out at school talent shows, at dance recitals, and if I remember correctly in the store Conway <br>
    The girl eventually started dancing at Dance Universal, this lead to her receiving 1st place on her Bollywood duet <br>
    After she graduated from P.S.132 she went to middle school and this is school lead her to question her friendships, hobbies, and <br>
    likes... Middle schoolers can be harsh, which they are by the way but middle school isn't something big and eventful for Anais <br>
    so let's skip those 3 years she can never get back!!!! <br>

    Now Anais enters high school as a 4'8  but being short is cool because we get scholarships <br>
    Yes she knows she is short, everytime you see her you don't have to say "oh you are so short" <br>
    don't remind someone of something they can't fix, IF THEY CAN'T FIX IT 5 MINUTES DON'T POINT IT OUT <br>
    How would you like it if everytime I saw you I'll say "oh you are so average/tall" <br>
    IT DOESN'T FEEL NICE AFTER AWHILE SO PLEASE STOP <br>
    Anyway high school... turns out High School Musical lied at least in Anais' experience <br>

    In high school Anais had to make new friends who she will only be with for 10 months because in the 10th grade she went to <br>
    International Baccalaureate or IB, look it up if you don't know...
    <h3> High School</h3> High school made Anais question her friendships (no shocker), likes, and most importantly her sexuality... <br>
